# Timetable-organiser

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

You will be able to input tasks that need completion into an interface. Next, you indicate the importance + time each task will take. 
After, an AI model will sort these into a neat schedule for you to use.


## Background

* problem 1: People are unorganised. My automated timetable machine will help them be more productive and structure their day.
* problem 2: People are too lazy to make schedules themselves. My AI will help to solve this issue by creating an optimal timetable for the user within seconds.
